# BallBounce
Ball bounce is the working name for my first game. A simple game to learn how to use Unity. The premise is that a spaceship is being sucked into a black hole, but most critical systems are down. The ship must use force fields to bounce around and recharge by bouncing through magnetic tubes.

I created the prototype for this game during the Create With Code Live course in May of 2020.
